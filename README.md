### About the Experiment 

Clay is extremely fine-grained natural soil material (with < 2 microns size) containing clay minerals (aluminum silicate), 
which acts as binder material in molding sand. Moulding sand contains 2 â€“ 50% clay. 
When clay is mixed with water it imparts strength, plasticity and good binding strength
