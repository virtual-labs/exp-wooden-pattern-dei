      "question": "Why is adhesive used to join the wooden pieces together? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make the pattern look better",
        "b": "To ensure the final pattern is a single unit",
        "c": "To increase the weight of the pattern",
        "d": "To make the pattern reusable"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Adhesive is used to bond separate wooden pieces together, forming a single, strong unit that maintains its shape during the casting process.",

      "question": "Why is the wooden pattern used in the casting process? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To be converted directly into metal",
        "b": "To create the mould cavity",
        "c": "To be used as a part of the final casting",
        "d": "To check the metal composition"
      },
