      "explanations": {
        "a": "Draft allowance is necessary when patterns have slightly tapered surfaces because it facilitates the removal of the pattern from the mold cavity.",
        "b": "Draft allowance is necessary when patterns have slightly tapered surfaces because it facilitates the removal of the pattern from the mold cavity.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Risers are necessary because they provide a reservoir of molten metal to compensate for shrinkage during solidification. As the casting cools, it undergoes shrinkage, which can result in defects like shrinkage voids.",

      "question": "Machining allowance is necessary in casting because:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Material may contract",

        "a": "Machining allowance in casting compensates for potential dimensional variations during the casting process, ensuring that final parts can be machined to meet required specifications.",
