## Pattern
1.	A pattern is a mould forming tool in the hands of foundry men. 
2.	A pattern is the model or the replica of the object to cast. 
3.	Except for the various allowances a pattern exactly resembles the casting to be made. 
4.	A pattern may be defined as a model or form around which sand is packed to give rise to a cavity known as mould cavity in which when molten metal is poured, the result is cast object.

## Functions of a Pattern: 
1.	A pattern prepares a mould cavity for the purpose of making a casting.
2.	A pattern may contain projections known as core prints if the casting requires a core and need to be hallow.
3.	Runner, gates and risers (used for introducing and feeding molten metal to the mould cavity) may form the part of the pattern. 
4.	A pattern may help in establishing locating points on the mould and therefore on the casting with a purpose to check the casting dimensions. 
5.	Pattern establishes the parting line and parting surfaces in the mould. 
6.	Patterns properly made and having finished and smooth surfaces reduce casting defects.  
7.	Properly constructed patterns minimize overall cost of the castings.

## Pattern Making Machines: 
Besides the hand tools, a modern pattern makers shop needs some power-driven machines also. These machines help the pattern maker in 
• Increasing production. 
• Improving accuracy and maintaining consistency in the patterns.

## Performing many more operations easily and conveniently.
The following tools are used for different purposes by a pattern maker.
(a) Measuring, Making and Layout Tools
(i) Steel rule 			(ii) Shrinkage rule
(ii) Caliper 			(iv) Divider
(v) Marking gauge 		(vi) Trammels
(vii) Try square 		(viii) T-bevel
(ix) Combination square.

(b) Tools for clamping purposes:
(i) Hand vice (ii) Pattern maker’s vice
(iii) Bar clamp (iv) C-clamp
(v) Hand screw
(vi) Pinch dog (to hold wooden pieces together for joining etc.).

(c) Sawing Tools:
(i) Coping saw (ii) Bow saw
(iii) Compass saw (iv) Rip saw
(v) Crosscut saw (vi) panel saw
(vii) Back saw (viii) Dovetail saw
(ix) Miter saw with miter box.

## Allowances:
A pattern is always larger in size when compared to normal casting, because it carries 
certain allowances due to mechanical reasons and metallurgical reasons for example, 
shrinkage allowance is the result of metallurgical phenomenon whereas machining, 
draft, and other allowances are provided on the patterns because of mechanical reasons.

The various pattern allowances are:
(a) Shrinkage or contraction allowance.
(b) Machining or finishing allowance.
(c) Draft or topper allowance.
(d) Distortion or camber allowance.
(e) Shake or rapping allowance
